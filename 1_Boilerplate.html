<!-- in html we start by writing <!DOCTYPE html> to say ki boss this is an html file
now jaise ek part ko start krega to you have to end it as well right jasie <html lang='en'> starts html and you have to end it as well
    so to end it you write </html> 
    similarly for head and body 
    head me you basically "declare" stuuff jasie yaha pr you declare the charset i.e UTF-8
    and the title 

    ok so head and body are elements of html
 meta is a tag i.e inside head and title is also a tag which is inside the head
 body wale element me you have <h1> tag which basically prints it as heading you have to end this tag with</h1>
 some tags need an end while some dont
 heading tags i.e <h1> <h2> ..... require ending tags but meta doesnt and similarly <br> tag i.e a line break tag doesnt require an ending tag as well
    
    most of the work is done is the body part as head is mostly "declarations!" -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
 <!-- of just <html>  -->
<html lang='en'> 
    <head>
        <meta charset = 'UTF-8'>
        <title>My Website</title>
      
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World <h1>
        </body>
        
</html>
